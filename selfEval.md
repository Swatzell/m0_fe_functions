# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of? i'm proud I made it through this as certain parts were tough
- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications? they basically allow you to reuse them and also make it so you dont have to have a million lines of code to perform an action.
